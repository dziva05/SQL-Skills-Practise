# DeAndre Dziva SQL Portfolio 
Welcome to my SQL porfolio. Here, I practise working with SQL and aim to hone my abilities to design efficient databases, write complex queries, and optimise performance to deliver optimal results. Through this portfolio, I invite you to explore my collection of projects and if you have any queries please let me know on dzivade@gmail.com
